# hexagonal-template-go
go project template for hexagonal architecture structure.

## Description

This project is a set of ideas for implementing a hexagonal template for microservices in Go. I'm trying to follow William Kennedy's ideas about developing my own [design philosophy](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2017/01/develop-your-design-philosophy.html).

I am going to answer these questions posed by William.

Who is your audience?
What are your priorities?
When do you take exceptions to the rules?
How do things work?
Why you are making the decisions you make?

In the meantime, I will be trying to do the following things. You can find in this repository different branches with different ways to implement a microservice with Go.

1. I want to try to apply the William Kennedy's package oriented design.
